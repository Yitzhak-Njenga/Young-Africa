    Young Africa also believes in that<br>
    to tackle
    the global challenges facing humanity, it is
    necessary to leverage the mechanisms of big
   business to effect positive social change.
        To achieve this, Young  partners
         with 190+ internationally-renowned businesses,
          and welcomes their highest achieving young employees
           with a commitment to social impact, to the Young Africa Summit every year.

    These young leaders are empowered to create positive change<br>
     within their organisations and beyond. Their initiatives do not<br>
      all fit the SROI methodology, but they are responsible for some of <br>
      the most substantial positive social impact the Young Africa Community generates.
    
    The 2019 report includes more than 25 outstanding initiatives led <br>
    by Ambassadors within business. These range from a conservation project<br> 
    in the Andees to the design of a new 
    purpose for one of the world's largest multinational companies. Young leaders
     within large corporations are taking the initiative and shaping the direction of their business
